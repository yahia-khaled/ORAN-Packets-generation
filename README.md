There are three CPP files,
Ethernet.cpp
have two main functions:
first,read_configuration:
that read configuration from second_milestone.txt and read IQ samples from iq_sample.txt, then it checks output validity and consistency.
second, generate an Ethernet frame in the following steps:
1. calculation of variables and initialization
Calculate the number of ORAN packets, the number of Ethernet frames, and initialize variables used in the generation process, such as last_byte_position, which tracks the location where the last octet has been written, and different IDs for frame headers.
2. Generate headers and content of packets
We start generating packets by generating different headers forÂ 
Ethernet, ecpri, and ORAN headers, then we output IQ samples such that each sample is represented in 8 bits.
3. generate CRC bits
We start to calculate CRC bits by passing the payload of an Ethernet packet to the function CRC, which returns an array that contains 32-bit CRC.
4. IFGs aligning and sending minimum IFGs
Send IFGs such that packets are 4-byte aligned, then send 12 IFGs that are minimum required between packets.
5. Repeat the above steps until the frame content is finished, then wait for frame duration to send the next frame content.
